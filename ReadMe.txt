I will commit changes later tonight that have a more informative interface but for now here are some of the controls: 
- arrow keys to rotate 90 degrees in different directions
- shift + arrow keys to go to preset rotations (helps with visualising since it alligns the wind speed vectors)
- right click and drag to rotate around
- scroll to zoom

Also to run you need to download the same 3rd party as in assignment 3 (setup is the same, set environment variable THIRDPARTY_DIR). 
Note that you cannot copy previous thrird party directory since the assignment Cmake file does some file changes on the first run, 
thus you need to unzip the original 3rdparty.zip file given in the assignment. 
I will add a drive link to the zip here later tonight if you don't have it.
