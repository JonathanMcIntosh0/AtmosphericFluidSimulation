To run, you need to download the same 3rd party as in assignment 3 (setup is the same, set environment variable THIRDPARTY_DIR).
Note that you cannot copy previous third party directory since the assignment Cmake file does some file changes on the first run,
thus you need to unzip the original 3rdparty.zip file given in the assignment. 
Drive link to the zip if you don't have it:
